98% probability of giving positive result when applied to a person suffering from thripshaws disease
10% probability of giving false positive when applied to a healthy person
0.5% of pop have the disease

My Guesses:
1. Be Positive = a little higher than 10%
2. Correctly diagnose a sufferer of thripshaw's = 98%
3. 90%
4. >50%

Actual:
P(Positive Test|Infected) = 98%
P(Infected) = 0.5%
P(Positive Test|Not Infected) = 10%
P(Infected|Positive Test) = P(Positive Test|Infected)*P(Infected)/P(Positive Test)

1. Prob of being positve = 98%*0.5% + 10%*99.5% = 10.44%
2. Correctly Diognose a sufferer = 98% since that is the probability listed in the question
3. Correctly identify a non-sufferer = 90% since there is a 10% false positive rate
4. Missclassify the person = 2%*0.5%+10%*99.5% = 9.96%
